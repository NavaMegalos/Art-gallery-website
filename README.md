## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- LESS preprocessor
- BEM CSS

### What I learned

Hi everyone, in this occasion I learnt a couple of things like how DO NOT USE GRID in this way I think I did more overengineering that it requires though I have to learn best practices about it, also I learn a couple of useful things about image resizing or image responsive for future projects, I learnt more about viewports and how to distribute the media queries in a more efficient way so I am proud of this project 'cause it helps me to improve my skills, see you people, if u have any tip or advice for me, you can give a touch!.
